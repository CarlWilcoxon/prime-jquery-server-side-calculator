# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_One evening_

The assignment was to create a calculator that would perform various computations on a local node server. The user enters in two numbers, presses enter and the calculator would find the result and display it on the DOM.


## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation


How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Run `npm init -y` in your terminal from the workplace folder.
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal from the workplace folder.
3. Run `npm start` to start the server and Control-C to stop it when you are done.

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Run `npm start` in your terminal to start the server.
2. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000/
3. Enters in two numbers and select what kind of operation you want.
4. Presses enter and the calculator would find the result and display it on the DOM.
5. There will also be a list of past calculations at the bottom.
6. When you are done, close the browser, go back to your terminal and press Control-C to stop the server when you are done.
